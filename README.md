2. **Revenue Insights**:
   - Determine the total revenue generated.
   - Identify the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
3. **Popular Items**:
   - Find the highest-priced pizza.
   - Determine the most common pizza size ordered.
   - List the top 5 most ordered pizza types with quantities.
4. **Category-Wise Trends**:
   - Analyze category-wise distribution of pizzas.
   - Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
5. **Time-Based Trends**:
   - Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
   - Group orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
   - Analyze cumulative revenue trends over time.
